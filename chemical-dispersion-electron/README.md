# Chemical Dispersion Modeling - Electron Application

## Project Refactor Summary

This project has been successfully refactored from a .NET WPF application to a cross-platform Electron application using TypeScript and React. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ **Complete Architecture Migration**
- **From**: .NET 8 WPF with C# and MVVM
- **To**: Electron with TypeScript, React, and Redux

### ✅ **Sophisticated Physics Engine Ported**
- **Gaussian Plume Modeling**: Complete atmospheric dispersion calculations
- **Pasquill-Gifford Parameters**: All stability classes (A-F) implemented
- **Multi-Contour Visualization**: Realistic concentration levels with organic shapes
- **Downwind Corridor**: Visible wind direction patterns
- **Real Weather Integration**: NWS and OpenMeteo API support

### ✅ **Cross-Platform Database**
- **From**: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework
- **To**: SQLite with native Node.js integration
- **Full Schema**: Chemicals, releases, weather data, dispersion results

### ✅ **Modern React Architecture**
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for application state
- **Component Architecture**: Modular React components
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- **React-Leaflet**: Interactive mapping with dispersion overlays

### ✅ **Complete Service Layer**
- **Weather Service**: Real-time atmospheric data fetching
- **Dispersion Service**: Atmospheric physics calculations
- **Database Service**: SQLite data persistence
- **Electron IPC**: Secure main-renderer communication

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn package manager

### Setup Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the Electron application directory
cd chemical-dispersion-electron

# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Run the application in development mode
npm run dev

# Or run the built application
npm start

# Build for distribution
npm run dist
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Development mode with hot reload
- `npm run build`: Build both main and renderer processes
- `npm start`: Run the built application
- `npm run dist`: Create distribution packages
- `npm run dist:win`: Build Windows installer
- `npm run dist:mac`: Build macOS DMG
- `npm run dist:linux`: Build Linux AppImage

## Application Features

### 🌪️ **Realistic Atmospheric Dispersion**
- Gaussian plume modeling with Pasquill-Gifford stability classes
- Multi-concentration contours (10%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%)
- Organic plume shapes that conform to atmospheric physics
- Visible downwind corridors showing wind direction

### 🗺️ **Interactive Mapping**
- Click-to-set release locations
- Real-time weather data integration
- Professional Leaflet-based mapping
- Multiple visualization layers

### 🌡️ **Weather Integration** 
- National Weather Service API
- OpenMeteo backup service
- Real-time atmospheric conditions
- Automatic stability class determination

### 💾 **Data Management**
- SQLite database for cross-platform compatibility
- Chemical library management
- Release scenario storage
- Dispersion result history

### ⚛️ **Modern Architecture**
- React with TypeScript
- Redux state management
- Electron main/renderer processes
- Secure IPC communication

## Key Improvements Over .NET Version

1. **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. **Modern UI**: React-based interface with better responsiveness
3. **Lightweight Database**: SQLite instead of PostgreSQL requirement
4. **Enhanced Physics**: More sophisticated atmospheric modeling
5. **Better Performance**: Optimized JavaScript calculations
6. **Developer Experience**: TypeScript for better code quality

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build the application: `npm run build` 
3. Test in development: `npm run dev`
4. Create distribution: `npm run dist`

The application maintains all the sophisticated atmospheric physics and realistic dispersion modeling while providing a modern, cross-platform experience.
